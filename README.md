Building a container-based IP address web site on Amazon ECS.

Please be forewarned that this lab is fairly expensive. AWS promises to save you up to 50% on compute costs by utilizing autonomous scaling, provisioning, and usage-based pricing. However the costs of even a lab environment add up quickly. Here the top costs:
- VPC costs
  - includes public IP address pricing (Elastic IP); reduce by removing the public IP addresses on the load balancers
  - ‚ùìis this even possible
  - is the internet gateway this cost?
- ELB costs - you pay for AWS resources to run the load balancer(s)
  - per application load balancer-hour
  - per LCU-hour (load)
- EC2 costs - I can find no explanation why these costs increased
  - EC2-Instances / EC2 Running Hours ran up a large bill
  - We configure Load balancers in EC2, but then we get ELB costs broken out. Target group costs would seem to be under ECS. What am I being billed for here?
  - I tagged all my resources (e.g., "ipdice" with no value) but cannot use the tage in the Cost Explorer
- ECS costs - you pay for the memory and vCPU resourcs the containers use
  - reduce costs by useing the minimum required CPU and memory
- WAF costs
- Scaling costs - use step scaling and reduce the maximum number of containers

# Overview and Genesis
After building a number of container web apps and deploying them to on-premise Kubernetes (k8), I wanted to try a real-world use case. Patterning after https://github.com/doritoes/ipgiraffe.com, I am creating a new site to return a more complete and playful IP Address web site experience.

Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) offers a simplified experience with tight integration with AWS services. This is just what I want for my lab.
- I haven't used ECS before
- Use Route 53 and CloudFront for multi-regions support
- Supports service auto scaling (container instances)
- Supports capacity provider scaling

This demonstration site has the following features:
* No ads
* No SQL backend
* Serverless computing on Fargate
* Small container based on Alpine Linux
* Demonstrate global autoscaling container applications without breaking the bank (don't want to cost too much for this free site)
* Gradually release new experiences to the web application
* Integration with external geo-location API
* Fun easter eggs to find

# Project Goals
Here are the goals I have for this project. If you would like to encourage me to add additional goals or to complete these goals, I'm open to [contributions](https://account.venmo.com/u/unclenuc) to pay my Cloud bills.

This is mean to be a step-by-step Lab exercise that you can follow along to.

## In Scope
### Completed
- Register domain name
- Bootstrapping repo on Github
- Bootstrapping image on Docker Hub
- Basic IP address experience
- One region built
- Multi-region
- Added first two easter eggs
- Multi-region
- Add anti-snoop protection
- Integration with https://www.ip-api.com for geo-location

### Working on
- Improvement and testing
### Will Do
- No major work at this point
### Might Do
- Feature: Dice rolling experience
- Feature: API for dice rolls (using custom dice rolling algorithm)
- Feature: API for physical dice roles (rolled and captured by Raspberry Pi-powered physical device)
## Out of Scope
- Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) doesn't meet my criteria for integrating a new technology for me. I have done other Kubernetes labs ([here](https://www.unclenuc.com/lab:kubernetes_app:start) and [here](https://www.unclenuc.com/lab:stack_of_nucs:start)).
- Azure and GCP are out of scope for this lab
